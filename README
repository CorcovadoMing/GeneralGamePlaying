    * Each game has a starting state.
        getInitialState() is the starting state.

    * Each state has legal moves for every player.
        getLegalMoves(state, role) are the legal moves for <role> in <state>.

    * Some states are terminal, and in those states "goal" values are defined
      for every player, indicating whether they won or lost.
        isTerminal(state) indicates whether a state is terminal.
        getGoal(state, role) is the goal value for <role> in <state>.

    * Given a legal move for each player, you can transition from one state to
      the next state, after the players make their respective moves.
        getNextState(state, moves) is the result of making <moves> at <state>.
